This project was made as part of the "The Complete Web Developer in 2018: Zero to Mastery" course on Udemy.
The intention was to build a face recognition application made with React. 

The objective of this API is to handle the user registration/login and connection to the database and to make calls to the Face Detection API made by Clarifai using Node and Express.
